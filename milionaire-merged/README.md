# Millionaires' Problem - COTI MPC Implementation

A decentralized implementation of **Yao's Millionaires' Problem** using COTI's Garbled Circuits (GC) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology.

## Unified UI in this folder (`milionaire-merged`)

Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` from **this directory**. The home screen is a **network selector** (COTI Testnet vs Sepolia). It lazy-loads the UIs from **[`../milionaire`](../milionaire)** (`/coti`) and **[`../milionaire-pod`](../milionaire-pod)** (`/sepolia`). Each route uses its own env keys — no runtime remapping:

- **`/coti`** — `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_COTI_TESTNET`, `COTI_TESTNET_RPC_URL`
- **`/sepolia`** — `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA`, `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`

See **`.env.example`**. Vite is configured with `envPrefix` so `SEPOLIA_*` and `COTI_*` keys are available in the browser bundle.

### Deploy the COTI contract (if you do not have one yet)

The default `hardhat compile` in this folder tries to compile both `contracts/coti` and `contracts/pod` and can fail on the PoD contract. For **COTI testnet only**, use:

```bash
npm run compile:coti
npm run deploy:coti
```

Set **`DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`** (recommended) or ensure **`VITE_ALICE_PK`** has test COTI for gas. The script prints **`VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_COTI_TESTNET=0x...`** to paste into `.env`. Deploy Sepolia (PoD) from **[`../milionaire-pod`](../milionaire-pod)**.

---

## Millionaire – Privacy on Demand (PoD)

The PoD variant lives in **[`../milionaire-pod`](../milionaire-pod)**. This section below describes that deployment model (Sepolia contract + COTI privacy). When you use the merged app and pick Sepolia, you are running that PoD UI. The flow and UX match the original (Alice and Bob submit encrypted wealth, trigger comparison, and receive encrypted results), but the deployment and privacy model differ.

### Where things run

| Layer | Network | What happens |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Contract & transactions** | **Sepolia** | The `MillionaireComparison` contract is deployed on Ethereum Sepolia. All on-chain interactions—submitting wealth, calling `compareWealth()`, reading results—are Sepolia transactions. The UI connects to Sepolia (e.g. `https://rpc.sepolia.org`) and uses Sepolia Etherscan for links. |
| **Privacy (encryption & MPC)** | **COTI Testnet** | Encryption of wealth values uses the **PoD encryption service** (POD keys, not local AES). The contract’s privacy logic (MPC comparison, result encryption) is executed via COTI’s infrastructure (inbox, MPC executor) so that **the privacy-sensitive work runs on COTI testnet** while the **state and transactions live on Sepolia**. |

So: **all user-facing interactions are on Sepolia**; the **privacy parts run on COTI testnet**. You get the same millionaire comparison with PoD, on an EVM testnet (Sepolia) you can use with standard tools and explorers.

## 🎯 Overview

The Millionaires' Problem is a classic cryptographic challenge introduced by Andrew Yao in 1982. It demonstrates secure multi-party computation where two parties (Alice and Bob) can determine who is wealthier without revealing their actual wealth to each other.

### The Problem

- Alice has wealth **A**
- Bob has wealth **B**
- They want to know: **A > B**, **A < B**, or **A = B**
- **Constraint:** Neither Alice nor Bob should learn the other's actual wealth value

### Solution

This implementation uses COTI's privacy-preserving MPC technology deployed on the COTI testnet to:
- Encrypt wealth values using each party's private AES key
- Perform comparison operations on encrypted data
- Return encrypted results that only each party can decrypt
- Ensure no third party (including blockchain validators) can see the actual wealth values


## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contract: `MillionaireComparison.sol`

The contract implements the following functionality:

1. **Initialization**: Contract is deployed with Alice and Bob's addresses
2. **Wealth Submission**: 
   - `setAliceWealth(itUint64 wealth)` - Alice submits encrypted wealth
   - `setBobWealth(itUint64 wealth)` - Bob submits encrypted wealth
3. **Comparison**: 
   - `compareWealth()` - Performs encrypted comparison using MPC
4. **Result Retrieval**:
   - `getAliceResult()` - Returns encrypted result for Alice to decrypt
   - `getBobResult()` - Returns encrypted result for Bob to decrypt

### Result Encoding

The comparison returns:
- `0` = Alice is richer
- `1` = Bob is richer
- `2` = Equal wealth


## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- COTI testnet account with test tokens
- Two separate wallets (one for Alice, one for Bob)


## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
cd milionaire-pod
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
# Sepolia RPC (contract and all UI interactions use Sepolia)
VITE_APP_NODE_HTTPS_ADDRESS=https://rpc.sepolia.org

# Alice Account (First Millionaire)
VITE_ALICE_PK=your_alice_private_key
VITE_ALICE_AES_KEY=your_alice_aes_key

# Bob Account (Second Millionaire)
VITE_BOB_PK=your_bob_private_key
VITE_BOB_AES_KEY=your_bob_aes_key

# Deployer Account (for hardhat deployment)
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_deployer_private_key
```

### 3. Compile the Smart Contract

```bash
npm run compile
```

### 4. Deploy to Sepolia (PoD)

Deploy the contract to Sepolia (privacy still runs on COTI testnet via PoD):

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-MillionaireComparisonPod.js --network sepolia
```

After deployment, copy the contract address and update your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...  # Your deployed contract address
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port Vite prints).


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Existing Deployment

1. **Start the React application**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port Vite prints)

2. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`)

3. **Compare wealth**
   - The app connects to the deployed contract
   - Enter wealth values for Alice and Bob
   - Perform encrypted comparison
   - View results without revealing actual wealth values

### Option 2: Deploy Your Own Contract

See the [Installation](#installation) section for detailed deployment instructions.


## 📱 How to Use

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Home Page**: 
   - Read about the Millionaires' Problem
   - **Alice's Panel**:
     - Enter Alice's wealth amount
     - Click "Submit" to encrypt and store on-chain
     - Click "Compare" to trigger the comparison
   - **Bob's Panel**:
     - Enter Bob's wealth amount
     - Click "Submit" to encrypt and store on-chain
     - Click "Compare" to trigger the comparison
   - **Results**:
     - Comparison results are displayed directly on the card
     - Each party can see the result (who is richer) without revealing specific amounts

### Important Notes

- Both Alice and Bob must submit their wealth before comparison can be performed
- Either party can trigger the comparison once both values are submitted
- The actual wealth values remain encrypted throughout the entire process
- Each party can only decrypt their own result

## 🔐 Smart Contract Features

### MillionaireComparison Contract

The contract implements the following functionality:

1. **Initialization**: Contract is deployed with Alice and Bob's addresses
2. **Wealth Submission**: 
   - `setAliceWealth(itUint64 wealth)` - Alice submits encrypted wealth
   - `setBobWealth(itUint64 wealth)` - Bob submits encrypted wealth
3. **Comparison**: 
   - `compareWealth()` - Performs encrypted comparison using MPC
4. **Result Retrieval**:
   - `getAliceResult()` - Returns encrypted result for Alice to decrypt
   - `getBobResult()` - Returns encrypted result for Bob to decrypt

### Result Encoding

The comparison returns:
- `0` = Alice is richer
- `1` = Bob is richer
- `2` = Equal wealth

### MPC Operations

The contract uses COTI's MPC Core library for:
- `validateCiphertext()` - Validates encrypted inputs
- `onBoard()` - Loads encrypted values for computation
- `offBoardCombined()` - Stores encrypted results
- `gt()` - Greater than comparison on encrypted values
- `mux()` - Conditional selection on encrypted values
- `and() / not()` - Logical operations on encrypted values


## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### Encryption

- **User-side encryption**: Wealth values are encrypted using each user's AES key before being sent to the contract
- **On-chain encryption**: Contract stores encrypted values using COTI's `utUint64` type (combined user + network ciphertext)
- **Result encryption**: Comparison results are encrypted specifically for each party

### MPC Operations

The contract uses COTI's MPC Core library for:
- `validateCiphertext()` - Validates encrypted inputs
- `onBoard()` - Loads encrypted values for computation
- `offBoardCombined()` - Stores encrypted results
- `gt()` - Greater than comparison on encrypted values
- `mux()` - Conditional selection on encrypted values
- `and() / not()` - Logical operations on encrypted values

### Privacy Guarantees

- ✅ Alice cannot see Bob's wealth
- ✅ Bob cannot see Alice's wealth
- ✅ Blockchain validators cannot see either wealth value
- ✅ Contract cannot leak wealth information
- ✅ Only the comparison result is revealed to both parties


## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Contract not configured error**
   - Ensure you've copied `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Verify contract address is set in `.env`
   - Check that the contract address is valid

2. **Wallet not configured error**
   - Verify private keys and AES keys are set for Alice and Bob
   - Ensure private keys don't include the `0x` prefix

3. **Transaction failures**
   - Ensure wallets have sufficient COTI for gas fees
   - Check network configuration (Chain ID: 7082400)
   - Verify you're connected to COTI Testnet

4. **Build errors**
   - Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
   - Ensure Node.js version is 16 or higher

### Getting Test COTI

To get test COTI for Testnet:

1. Visit the [COTI Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Z4r8D6ez49)
2. Navigate to the testnet faucet channel
3. Request test tokens for your wallet address


## Technical Deep Dive - MPC Implementation

### Understanding the Millionaires' Problem Implementation

This section provides a technical deep dive into how the Millionaires' Problem is implemented using COTI's Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology.


## Core Concepts

### 1. Garbled Circuits (GC)

COTI uses Yao's Garbled Circuits protocol for secure computation:
- **Input Privacy:** Each party's inputs remain encrypted throughout computation
- **Output Privacy:** Only authorized parties can decrypt the final result
- **Computational Security:** Based on cryptographic assumptions

### 2. Data Types

#### Input Types (Client-side)
- `itUint64` - Input ciphertext from user (encrypted with user's AES key)

#### Garbled Types (On-chain computation)
- `gtUint64` - Garbled/encrypted uint64 for computation
- `gtUint8` - Garbled/encrypted uint8 for computation  
- `gtBool` - Garbled/encrypted boolean for computation

#### User Types (Storage)
- `utUint64` - Combined user + network ciphertext (storage format)
- `utUint8` - Combined user + network ciphertext (storage format)

#### Output Types (Return values)
- `ctUint64` - User-specific ciphertext for decryption
- `ctUint8` - User-specific ciphertext for decryption


## Smart Contract Architecture

### State Variables

```solidity
utUint64 private _aliceWealth;    // Alice's encrypted wealth
utUint64 private _bobWealth;      // Bob's encrypted wealth
utUint8 private _aliceResult;     // Result encrypted for Alice
utUint8 private _bobResult;       // Result encrypted for Bob
bool private _aliceSet;           // Has Alice submitted?
bool private _bobSet;             // Has Bob submitted?
address private _alice;           // Alice's address
address private _bob;             // Bob's address
```

### Key Functions

#### 1. Wealth Submission (Alice)

```solidity
function setAliceWealth(itUint64 calldata wealth) external
```

**Process:**
1. Validate the caller is Alice
2. Validate the encrypted input using `MpcCore.validateCiphertext(wealth)`
3. Convert to garbled type: `gtUint64 gtWealth`
4. Store as combined ciphertext: `MpcCore.offBoardCombined(gtWealth, _alice)`

**Why offBoardCombined?**
- Creates a ciphertext that can be decrypted by Alice
- Adds network-level encryption for additional security
- Enables on-chain storage while maintaining privacy

#### 2. Wealth Submission (Bob)

```solidity
function setBobWealth(itUint64 calldata wealth) external
```

Same process as Alice, but with Bob's address and storage location.

#### 3. The Comparison Function

This is where the magic happens! Let's break it down:

```solidity
function compareWealth() external
```

**Step 1: Load Encrypted Values**

```solidity
gtUint64 aliceWealth = MpcCore.onBoard(_aliceWealth.ciphertext);
gtUint64 bobWealth = MpcCore.onBoard(_bobWealth.ciphertext);
```

`onBoard()` converts stored ciphertexts back to garbled types for computation.

**Step 2: Perform Comparisons**

```solidity
gtBool aliceGreater = MpcCore.gt(aliceWealth, bobWealth);  // Alice > Bob?
gtBool bobGreater = MpcCore.gt(bobWealth, aliceWealth);    // Bob > Alice?
```

These comparisons happen **on encrypted data**! The blockchain validators cannot see the actual values.

**Step 3: Encode Results**

We need to encode three possible outcomes:
- `0` = Alice is richer (aliceWealth > bobWealth)
- `1` = Bob is richer (bobWealth > aliceWealth)
- `2` = Equal wealth (neither is greater)

```solidity
gtUint8 zero = MpcCore.setPublic8(0);
gtUint8 one = MpcCore.setPublic8(1);
gtUint8 two = MpcCore.setPublic8(2);
```

**Step 4: Conditional Logic with MPC**

This is the clever part! We use `mux` (multiplexer) for conditional selection:

```solidity
// If Alice > Bob, result = 0, else result = 1
gtUint8 tempResult = MpcCore.mux(aliceGreater, one, zero);

// If Bob > Alice, result = 1, else keep tempResult
gtUint8 finalResult = MpcCore.mux(bobGreater, tempResult, one);

// Check if neither is greater (they're equal)
gtBool neitherGreater = MpcCore.and(
    MpcCore.not(aliceGreater),
    MpcCore.not(bobGreater)
);

// If equal, result = 2, else keep result
finalResult = MpcCore.mux(neitherGreater, finalResult, two);
```

**Understanding MPC.mux(condition, falseValue, trueValue):**
- If condition is true → returns trueValue
- If condition is false → returns falseValue
- **All encrypted!** The actual condition is never revealed

**Step 5: Store Encrypted Results**

```solidity
_aliceResult = MpcCore.offBoardCombined(finalResult, _alice);
_bobResult = MpcCore.offBoardCombined(finalResult, _bob);
```

Each party gets their own encrypted copy of the result.

#### 4. Result Retrieval

```solidity
function getAliceResult() public view returns (ctUint8) {
    require(msg.sender == _alice, "Only Alice can view her result");
    return _aliceResult.userCiphertext;
}
```

Returns the user-specific ciphertext that only Alice can decrypt.


## Client-Side Operations (React Hook)

### Encryption

```javascript
const encryptedValue = await wallet.encryptValue(
  BigInt(wealth),
  contractAddress,
  selector
);
```

**Parameters:**
- `BigInt(wealth)` - The plaintext value
- `contractAddress` - Address of the smart contract
- `selector` - Function selector (identifies which function will use this value)

**Output:** `itUint64` - Input ciphertext ready for contract

### Decryption

```javascript
const clearResult = await wallet.decryptValue(ctResult);
```

**Input:** `ctUint8` - Encrypted result from contract
**Output:** `BigInt` - Decrypted result (0, 1, or 2)


## Security Analysis

### What is Protected?

✅ **Alice's wealth value** - Never revealed in plaintext
✅ **Bob's wealth value** - Never revealed in plaintext
✅ **Intermediate computation results** - All encrypted
✅ **Which party triggered comparison** - Public info (but doesn't matter)

### What is Revealed?

❌ **Comparison result** - Both parties learn who is richer
❌ **That a comparison occurred** - Visible on blockchain
❌ **Participant addresses** - Public (Alice and Bob's addresses)

### Why is This Secure?

1. **Computational Security:**
   - Based on AES-256 encryption
   - Relies on hardness of breaking symmetric encryption

2. **Protocol Security:**
   - Uses Yao's Garbled Circuits
   - Proven secure in semi-honest model

3. **Network Security:**
   - COTI's MPC network validates computations
   - Multiple nodes participate without learning secrets

4. **Smart Contract Security:**
   - Access controls prevent unauthorized access
   - Results are encrypted for specific users only

## Performance Considerations

### Gas Costs

**Approximate gas usage:**
- `setAliceWealth()`: ~200,000 gas
- `setBobWealth()`: ~200,000 gas
- `compareWealth()`: ~500,000 gas
- `getAliceResult()`: ~50,000 gas (view function)

### Transaction Times

- **Submit wealth:** ~5-10 seconds (depends on network)
- **Perform comparison:** ~10-15 seconds (MPC computation)
- **Read result:** Instant (view function)


## Limitations and Considerations

### Current Implementation

1. **One-time comparison:** After comparison, contract needs reset for new values
2. **Two-party only:** Designed specifically for Alice and Bob
3. **Integer comparison:** Supports whole numbers only
4. **Public result:** Both parties learn the same comparison outcome

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Multiple rounds:** Allow resetting and comparing again
2. **Multi-party:** Extend to N millionaires
3. **Range queries:** "Is wealth above/below threshold?"
4. **Approximate comparison:** Add noise to protect against edge cases
